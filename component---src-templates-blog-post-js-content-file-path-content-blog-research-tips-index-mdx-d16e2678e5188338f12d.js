Pursue topics that fascinate you; the best work comes from enthusiasm. But also build in mechanisms that force you to be clear-headed about assessing the impact of your work over time. Evaluate on a timescale that suits your career and work (5-year windows align well with PhD student lifecycles), and humbly move on from topics where the impact isn\'t what you wanted. Time spent in industry—especially entrepreneurship—is helpful in learning this discipline; the market is an efficient (heartless!) teacher of lessons in adaptability and humility, as anyone whose startup has "pivoted" will share.

For example, working on AI-related topics right now demands that you produce a lot of quick-fire results in a tightly competitive arena. That requires an restless competitive streak: reading a ton, being quick to change, and doing research in relatively short bites on very popular topics. By contrast, meaningful systems work requires an investment of many years of engineering and teamwork, during which there will be fallow periods of publication. In that space, you need patience, good taste and self-confidence, because you don't get to change your mind nearly as often. There's no right answer here—you might enjoy a mixture, and one style is not inherently better than another. But it's good to make sure that your personal working style matches your topic selection. In your early days, finding role models in the literature can help—again, one role model may be quite different from another, so choose what appeals to you and reassess over time."),"\n"),"\n",o.createElement(t.li,null,"\n",o.createElement(t.p,null,o.createElement(t.strong,null,"Collaborate with Complementary Experts"),". It's good intellectual nutrition to collaborate with experts in a variety of other fields. A lot of the best research opportunities are at the seams between traditional fields, and it's more educational and fun to work with people who know and think about things different than your experience.\nFor faculty, I suggest spending ~5 years co-advising Ph.D. students with people in another field, whether that's across or outside CS. Then consider trying a new collaboration in a different field thereafter.\nDoing this will broaden your horizons, and teach you more about your own strengths: the ones that come from your education in your home field, and the ones that come from your personal research style and talents."),"\n"),"\n",o.createElement(t.li,null,"\n",o.createElement(t.p,null,o.createElement(t.strong,null,"For Topic Selection, Do Your (Qualitative) Research"),". This is maybe the least common advice in this list. To choose important problems—especially in user-facing areas—consider learning how to do qualitative research methods like interview studies, to figure out empirically what problems will have impact. I've been involved in doing this twice (once for ",o.createElement(t.a,{href:"http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2012-EnterpriseAnalysisInterviews-VAST.pdf"},"Enterprise Data Analytics"),", and more recently for ",o.createElement(t.a,{href:"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3653697"},"Machine Learning Engineering"),"). In both cases, the interview studies led to interesting and highly relevant follow-on constructive work, and the papers describing the studies and results were themselves well received: both won awards. Be aware: this is a lot of work to do well! (To be clear, in the cases above that work was not done by me—it was done by amazing students like ",o.createElement(t.a,{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Kandel"},"Sean Kandel"),", ",o.createElement(t.a,{href:"https://rlnsanz.github.io/"},"Rolando Garcia")," and ",o.createElement(t.a,{href:"https://www.sh-reya.com/"},"Shreya Shankar"),").
